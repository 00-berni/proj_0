# VISIBILITY OF A STAR

## <a id='toc1_1_'></a>[Task](#toc0_)

The aim of the exercise is to compute the visibility of a star from a set place and on a chosen date. The required procedure can be summed up in 5 steps:

1. compute the rise and the set of the star from the observatory
2. compute the rise and the set of the Sun
3. compute the twilight
4. compute the distance of the target from the Moon and the moon phase
5. estimate the visibility window, if any

The python library `visibility` collects all the functions to implement this tasks. For more details see the section about the library itself or the script.
